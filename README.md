# k8ty-haiku

A silly test project that prints a Haiku-like project name.

This project is really for testing as a homebrew formula + generating/distributing
binaries made with graalvm-native-image.

Builds with the amazing [sbt-native-image](https://github.com/scalameta/sbt-native-image)
`sbt nativeImage`
